SUMMARY
==========

Accessibility is not always inclusive. The design of products should be accessible to all people, regardless of their disability.

In scchools, kids with disabilities have to put a great deal of effort in planning and learning so as to compete with other students instead of assuming that they will be accommodated perfectly.

Many of the educational softwares are not created with people with disabilities in mind. With endless possibilities assistive technology
can provide, people with disabilities deserve to settle for nothing less than a world-class education.
I created an assistive educational software based on the principles of universal design to give students with disabilities access to
interactive educational content.Inclusive and assistive technologies can help achieve an unprecedented level of growth in the education sector.

The aim of this prject is to harness technology to achive inclusive education.

They have also expanded access to basic
opportunities and services and offered means to address environmental concerns.
However, not everyone has been able to benefit from such opportunities.
Harnessing technology and innovation to achieve the Sustainable Development
Goals and leaving no one behind requires promoting not only more technologies and
innovations but also more inclusive ones.
